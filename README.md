AzTfBeginnersCourse is a simple beginner's course to learn how to create Azure sites with Terraform.
We first install a working software system with Azure-cli (az), Git, and Terraform.
For Windows we utilize infamous Cygwin ;). Tested on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019.
Tested Linux versions are Ubuntu 18.04 LTS ans 20.04 LTS. Therefore, it should work on Debian Stretch.
